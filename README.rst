`Talon Voice <https://talonvoice.com/>`_ is a very nifty program. However, the documentation is...lacking. So this work is my documentation of how to code in it as well as my personal scripts. It borrows heavily based on the `official examples <https://github.com/talonvoice/examples>`_ as well as the `talon community scripts <https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community>`_

Basic Ideas
***********

Command Reference
*****************

The commands I value. In general, I've disabled other commands if I don't regularly value them. In theory, the help command is a substitute for this.

**talon sleep**
  Restricts the commands that Talon listens for, effectively turning it off.

**talon wake**
  Restore Talon's listening to all commands
